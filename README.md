# Serverless Framework Node HTTP API on AWS

This repository contains a serverless API developed to run on AWS Lambda. The API uses the Serverless Framework for deployment and management.

Installation
Before deploying this API to AWS, you need to make sure that you have the AWS CLI and the Serverless Framework installed.

Installing the AWS CLI
If you don't have the AWS CLI installed, follow these instructions:

Go to the AWS CLI documentation.
Select your operating system and follow the instructions.
Installing the Serverless Framework
If you don't have the Serverless Framework installed, follow these instructions:

Open a terminal window.

Run the following command to install the Serverless Framework:

```
npm install -g serverless
```
## Configuration

To deploy this API to AWS Lambda, you need to configure the serverless.yml file.

1. Open the serverless.yml file.

2. Find the provider section and replace the Resource property with the ARN of the DynamoDB table you created in AWS.

```
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x
  region: us-east-1
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: "Allow"
      Action:
        - dynamodb:Query
        - dynamodb:Scan
        - dynamodb:GetItem
        - dynamodb:PutItem
        - dynamodb:UpdateItem
        - dynamodb:DeleteItem
      Resource: <ARN of your DynamoDB table>
```

### Deployment

```
serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-http-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-http-api-project-dev (152s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: aws-node-http-api-project-dev-hello (1.9 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to the following (removed `input` content for brevity):

```json
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v2.0! Your function executed successfully!",
  "input": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\",\n  \"input\": \"\"\n}"
}
```


Alternatively, it is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).
